This repository contains two separate projects that I have completed related to data analysis: Diamonds and NBA.

## Diamonds Data Anlysis Project

The Diamonds project is an analysis of a dataset containing information about the characteristics and prices of various diamonds. In this project, I explored the relationships between different diamond characteristics such as carat weight, cut, and clarity, and their prices. I used various techniques including data cleaning, visualization etc.

### The project is contained in the Diamonds_Project folder and includes the following files:

diamonds.csv: the dataset used in the analysis
Diamonds.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
Diamonds.html: an HTML version of the notebook

## NBA Data Analysis Project

The NBA Data Analysis project is an analysis of a dataset containing information about NBA player statistics from the 1996 to 2022 season. In this project, I explored various questions such as which players scores the points since 1996 , which players didnt attend college etc, and my favorite players Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown stats since they entered the NBA. I used techniques such as data cleaning, visualization, analysis to answer these questions.

### The project is contained in the NBA_Data_Analysis_Project folder and includes the following files:

NBA.csv: the dataset used in the analysis
NBA.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook containing the analysis
NBA.html: an HTML version of the notebook

## Conclusion

Both of these projects were completed as part of my learning journey in data analysis and showcase my ability to apply various techniques to gain insights from datasets. I hope that they can be helpful to others who are learning or working in this field.
